## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11**
- **Python 3.8+** ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Microphone**
- **~1GB RAM** (with base model)
- **Administrator privileges** (for global hotkey)

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matdac12/whisper-dictation.git
cd whisper-dictation
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The first time you run the app, Whisper will download the base model (~141MB) automatically.

### 4. GPU Support (Optional - Recommended for Best Performance)

For **10-20x faster** transcription with NVIDIA GPU, you'll need CUDA 12.x and cuDNN 9 installed, plus CTranslate2 with GPU support.

**Installation:**
- **System requirements:** NVIDIA GPU driver + CUDA 12.x + cuDNN 9 (download from NVIDIA website)
- See the [faster-whisper documentation](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper#gpu) for current GPU installation instructions
- See the [CTranslate2 installation guide](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/installation.html) for CUDA requirements and compatible versions
- [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

CTranslate2 will automatically detect and use your GPU if CUDA is properly installed. CPU-only mode still works great with the optimizations!

**Note:** The model will download automatically on first launch (~141MB for base model)

## Quick Start

### Option A: Single Launch
```bash
python systray_dictation.py
```

### Option B: Silent Launch (No Terminal)
Double-click: **`run_systray.vbs`**

*Approximate latency for 10 seconds of audio with optimizations enabled

## Log File

All transcriptions are saved to `dictation_log.txt` in the app directory.

**Format:**
```
[2024-10-17 14:30:45] (2.34s) Hello this is a test message
[2024-10-17 14:31:12] (1.89s) Another dictation example
```

View it anytime by right-clicking the systray icon ‚Üí "View Log"

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Notifications don't appear
- Ensure you're running the app as Administrator
- Check Windows notification settings
- Try restarting the app

### ‚ùå Microphone not being detected
- Check Windows Sound Settings (right-click speaker icon ‚Üí Sound settings)
- Ensure your microphone is set as the default recording device
- Test with Windows Sound Recorder
- Restart the app

### ‚ùå Hotkey doesn't work
- Make sure you're running as Administrator
- Some applications may hijack global hotkeys
- Try a different hotkey key combination
- Close other hotkey-binding apps (Discord overlays, etc.)

### ‚ùå Slow transcription
- First run downloads the model (~141MB) - this is normal
- **Install GPU support** for 10-20x speedup - see [GPU Support section](#4-gpu-support-optional---recommended-for-best-performance) for installation links
- Use a smaller model (tiny or base) - edit line 281 in `systray_dictation.py`
- Check CTranslate2 logs on startup to see if GPU was detected
- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Ensure you have the latest version with all optimizations

### ‚ùå "No module named..." error
```bash
# Make sure venv is activated:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Reinstall dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚ùå App crashes immediately
- Run from PowerShell with error messages: `python systray_dictation.py`
- Check your microphone is working
- Ensure Python 3.8+ installed

## File Structure

```
whisper-dictation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ systray_dictation.py      # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_systray.vbs           # Silent launcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dictation_log.txt         # Auto-generated transcription log

```

## How It Works

1. **Recording** - Captures audio from your microphone in real-time
2. **Processing** - Whisper model converts audio to text (runs locally)
3. **Output** - Text is copied to clipboard and shown in notification
4. **Logging** - Everything is saved with timestamp and duration

No data is ever sent to external servers - it's 100% local processing!

## Performance Optimizations

This app includes several optimizations for Windows:

1. **faster-whisper** - Uses CTranslate2 for 4-8x faster CPU inference
2. **Auto GPU detection** - Automatically uses NVIDIA GPU if available (10-20x speedup)
3. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** - Removes silence before/after speech for faster processing
4. **Windows native notifications** - Uses toast notifications instead of tkinter popups
5. **Optimized audio buffering** - Uses deque for efficient memory management

### Performance Tips

- **Install CUDA support** - Get massive speedup on NVIDIA GPUs (see GPU Support section above)
- **Use 'tiny' or 'base' model** - Best balance of speed and accuracy for most use cases
- **First launch is slower** - Model downloads and initializes (~141MB)
- **Subsequent launches are instant** - Model is cached locally
- **Speak clearly with pauses** - Better accuracy and natural speech patterns
- **Quiet environment** - Reduces background noise for better transcription
